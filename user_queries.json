It connects the actions of the clinician (ingredients) with the changes produced in the patient or other recipient of treatment. The RTSS encompasses treatment delivered to individual patients or caregivers, including modifications at home intended for one person. It is descriptive, not prescriptive, and seeks to specify all rehabilitation treatments to compare the effects of their ingredients on specific targets and evaluate their impact on different types of patients with similar target problems."}, {"query": "Can it mention on football training?", "response": "The text does not explicitly mention \"football training,\" but the ball-tossing activity could be adapted to incorporate elements of football if appropriate for the patient's goals and abilities."}, {"query": "what are the three treatment goups ?", "response": "The three treatment groups are: Organ Functions treatment group, Skills and Habits treatment group, and Representations treatment group."}, {"query": "what is aphasia?", "response": "The provided text does not define aphasia."}, {"query": "Can you explian me propensities to act?", "response": "Propensities to act are considered changes in attitudes.
